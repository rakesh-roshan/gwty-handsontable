## Overview

gwty-handsontable is wrapper for the famous maps javascript library [HandsOnTable](http://leafletjs.com/). gwty-handsontable is based on JsInterop and allows using HandsonTable from your GWT application exactly the same way as from a javascript script with a slight advantage: static typing. It was partially generated automatically from Leaflet docs.


##Dependency

Also, do not forget to include gwty-leaflet in your .gwt.xml module definition file:

```xml
 <inherits name='com.gwidgets.api.GwtyHandsonTable' />

```


## GWT version:

gwty-hansontable is compiled using GWT 2.8.0-rc2.
